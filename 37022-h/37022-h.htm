<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD"></a>FOREWORD.</h2>


<p>There has been so much adulation lately of
Australia, Australian institutions, and the Australian
people by writers with axes to grind and
English politicians with party ends to serve that
the people of the Commonwealth have come to
believe that they are the salt of the earth, and
that their country is the earth. Personally, I am
impatient of such credulity, and I think it is
time somebody called upon the self-satisfied Australians
to show cause why a little more humility
and a little less arrogance were not more seemly.
With a view to restoring an apparently lost sense
of proportion to the press and public of the
country, I have written the following pages. If in
telling the truth I shame the Australian this book
will achieve its object. Should a howl of indignation
be provoked, then will the condition of affairs
be proved worse than my pen has power to depict,
and nothing will be left but to declare Australia
past redemption. This is the case for the prosecution.</p>

AUSTRALIAN POLITICS.</h2>


<p>This strange, topsy-turvey country, not content
with having fruit with stones on the outside, has
made the unique experiment of handing over its
government to its peasantry! Other lands have
at times fallen under the sway of the hoi-polloi, but
this has always been temporary, and the result
of some hysterical upheaval. But in Australia
this has not been the case. The electors calmly
and deliberately voted the Labour Party into
power in April, 1910, and, since then, two of the
six ridiculous States that this country of four and
a-half millions has divided itself into have also
calmly and deliberately decided, by majorities,
to entrust their national guidance to butchers and
bakers and candlestick-makers.</p>

<p>That any body of people should do this&mdash;even
in a country where every man and woman, irrespective
of education, wealth, or social position has
a vote&mdash;seems unintelligible to the English visitor.
It certainly was unintelligible to me at first. It
grew more of a mystery when I saw and heard
several of the Labour leaders. Then I saw and
heard the Liberal leaders, and I no longer wondered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Of all the products of Australia, the politician
is the least worthy and the least competent.
Oratory in this land is in the same embryo condition
as gem-cutting or the manufacture of scientific
instruments. Generally speaking, there is not
in the public life of Australia a speaker who
reaches to the standard of mediocrity in England
or America. And in speaking, so is it much in the
other qualifications that make a politician. The
present Prime Minister, Mr. Fisher, I heard in
Melbourne just before he left for England. Knowing
him to have been a miner, I was prepared. It
would be unfair to compare Mr. Fisher with one
of our cultured statesmen at home. But put him
beside another miner&mdash;Mr. Keir Hardie&mdash;the comparison
is ludicrous. I was told to wait until I
heard Mr. Deakin, and, as luck would have it, I
did get an opportunity of hearing Mr. Deakin at a
social function at Toorak. Mr. Deakin was fluent,
I'll say that for him, but to regard him as an
orator or even an average public speaker is ridiculous
to one accustomed to the polished delivery
and deep thought of our English politicians.</p>

<p>Among the minor members of the London County
Council are many speakers who stand head and
shoulders over Mr. Deakin. I also heard Mr.
Hughes, Mr. Tudor, and that amusing gentleman
Mr. King O'Malley while I was in Melbourne,
but I must admit that I was not deeply impressed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
The great ones of the Victorian State Parliament
I missed, which is possibly as well, if it bears
any resemblance to the State Parliament of New
South Wales. In this deliberative Assembly I
found the standard even lower than in the Federal
Parliament. I was unfortunate&mdash;or was I fortunate?&mdash;in
not being able to hear Mr. McGowen.
That gentleman was already in England, upholding
the honour of New South Wales by hammering a
rivet in a girder and walking three miles along a
sewer.</p>

<p>But I heard Mr. Holman and I heard Mr.
Wade, and I heard Mr. Edden and Mr. Wood
and Mr. Fitzpatrick, and several other funny
little men whose names I cannot remember. Mr.
Holman reminded me of the Polytechnic young
man who apes the style of the Oxford Union.
Mr. Wade was a lame and halting speaker, whose
thoughts moved slowly, and whose diction was
execrable. Mr. Edden reminded me of an old
gardener we had at home. Mr. Wood was the
colonial excelsis. He has the Australian accent
strongly developed, he uses slang indiscriminately,
and he is bumptious and aggressive. Mr. Fitzpatrick
struck me as a mild man naturally trying
hard to be like Mr. Wood. The others were
colourless. In point of ability, it was ludicrous
to think of these men controlling the destinies of a
colony&mdash;even one of a paltry million and a-half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
people. I doubt very much if Mr. Holman or Mr.
Wade would ever be elected to the London County
Council or even one of the surrounding vestries. If
they contrived to do so, they would certainly never
go back at the ensuing election. Messrs. Holman
and Wade in the London County Council would
be simply overwhelmed. The inherent bluster of
the Australian might prevent them being shamed
to silence by the preponderating ability that surrounded
them, but it would not be many days
before they were forgotten, overlooked, and not
even accorded the dignity of an "also spoke" by
the press. To think of such politicians being in
the Mother of Parliaments is enough to make the
legislative angels weep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_II" id="Chapter_II"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter II.</span><br />
THE AUSTRALIAN ACCENT.</h2>


<p>One of the strongest prejudices that one has to
overcome when one visits Australia is that created
by the weird jargon that passes for English in this
country. Created is too mild a term to apply to
the process. It comes as a positive shock, and I
recall with actual pain the morning I awoke as the
mailboat lay at Fremantle breakwater, and I heard
this horrible patois filter through my porthole to
offend my ear for the first time.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, English people who have lived
in the colonies for any length of time grow accustomed
to the pronunciation of the Australian, and,
worst of all, it insinuates itself into their own language,
until it is really difficult to find a resident
of more than ten years' standing in Australia who
does not sing-song like a native.</p>

<p>The Australian accent has frequently been described
by travellers, but none have done justice to
its abominations. Many unobservant persons,
shuddering through three or four months' experience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
have left Australia saying that the people
of the island continent use the dialect of the East
End of London. This is a gross injustice to poor
Whitechapel. Neither the coster of to-day, nor the
old-time Cockney of the days of Dickens, would be
guilty of uttering the uncouth vowel sounds I
have heard habitually used by all classes in Australia.
For the dialect of this country differs
from those of other lands in being as strongly
developed among the educated people as among
the peasantry. Were its use restricted to the
bullock-driver and the larrikin one could make
excuses; but this is not so. Judges, scientists,
University graduates, and bottle-gatherers use the
same universal Australian esperanto. The doctor,
who has attained eminence in Australia, and who,
in point of merit, is probably quite up to the
standard of the average provincial practitioner at
Home, will give such words as "light" and
"bright" the same exaggerated vowel sound as
the cabman and the bootblack. The barrister will
not say, "May your Honour please," but "May-ee
yer Honour please." The scientist will refer to
"Me researches." There is no such word as
"my" in the Australian language. "Me husband,
me yacht, me motor," one hears everywhere.
But the most striking instance of vowel mispronunciation
occurs in respect of the diphthong "ow."
A cow is invariably a "keeow," brown is "bree-own,"
town is "teeown."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>So exaggerated is the Australian's rendering of
this sound that they actually accuse English people
of being in error. "Naturally the difference would
strike you," once said a leading Australian journalist
to me, with a superior smile; "you English
people always say rahnd the tahn and talk about
milking a brahn cah." I was too used to Australian
self-sufficiency by that time to take offence.
The people had ceased to offend me and commenced
to amuse me.</p>

<p>But it is not so much the vagaries of pronunciation
that hurt the ear of the visitor. It is
the extraordinary intonation that the Australian
imparts to his phrases. There is no such thing
as cultured, reposeful conversation in this land;
everybody sings his remarks as if he were reciting
blank verse after the manner of an imperfect
elocutionist. It would be quite possible to take
an ordinary Australian conversation and immortalise
its cadences and diapasons by means of
musical notation. Herein the Australian differs
from the American. The accent of the American,
educated and uneducated alike, is abhorrent to the
cultured Englishman or Englishwoman, but it is,
at any rate, harmonious. That of the Australian
is full of discords and surprises. His voice rises
and falls with unexpected syncopations, and, even
among the few cultured persons this country possesses,
seems to bear in every syllable the sign of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the parvenu. There is a nouveau riche in culture as
well as in material things, and the accent of the
cultivated Australian proclaims to the world that
his acquisition of learning belongs to his generation
alone. At Home, we are occasionally forced
to encounter individuals whose sudden access to
money is revealed by their tongues, but we are
spared from such unpleasant revelations when we
meet the intellectuals. These are products of
generations. In Australia, they are turned out
while you wait, with all the uncouthness of their
fathers. Australia alone of all the countries in the
world has lingual hobnails on its culture.</p>

<p>In the counties of Great Britain and the provinces
of continental Europe the possession of a
marked dialect denotes lowly origin. The educated
gentleman of Yorkshire or Sligo is differentiated
only by a very slight and not displeasing
accent. In fact, in Great Britain, the dialect is
of some benefit in indicating the origin of the
man who uses it. I have frequently found it of
value in engaging servants and in dealing with
the lower classes generally. But in Australia, this
abominable pronunciation pervades the entire continent.
The native of Perth and the native of
Townsville use precisely the same phrases pronounced
precisely the same way, gentleman and
labourer alike. Possibly this is one of the results
of the extraordinary democracy of this country&mdash;a
democracy which makes Jack as good as his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
master. Perhaps it is a cause rather than an effect.
When Jack finds his master speaking in the same
manner as he does himself, and, making no effort
to maintain his position as a gentleman, he is not
so much to be blamed for thinking that he is as
good as his master&mdash;and in Australia he probably
is.</p>

<p>The Australian's practice of singing his remarks
I can only ascribe to the influence of the Chinese.
During my stay in Melbourne, I spent one evening
at supper in a Chinese cook-shop in Little
Bourke street, and I was instantly struck by the
resemblance between the intonation of the phrases
passing between the Chinese attendants and that
of the conversation of the cultivated Australians
who accompanied me. But, in addition to this
lack of good-breeding and the gross mispronunciation
of common English words, the Australian interlards
his conversation with large quantities of slang,
which make him frequently unintelligible to the
visitor. This use of slang is so common that the
public memory forgets that it is slang, and it finds
its way into most unexpected places. Chief Justices
on their benches, leading newspapers in their editorials,
statesmen&mdash;such as Australia boasts&mdash;all
disfigure their utterances by jarring slang terms
and phrases, so commonly used as to pass unnoticed
by either their hearers or themselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>English slang has a foundation of humour. There
is a note of whimsical comedy about the Oxford
undergraduate's practice of calling a bag a bagger,
and nobody can repress a smile the first time he
hears a coster call eyes "meat-pies" or trousers
"round-the-houses." But there is no humour in
Australian slang. It is drawn from the lowliest
sources&mdash;the racecourse, the football match, and the
prize-ring. Like most of the imagery of primitive
people, it is largely metaphorical, so involved as to
require an interpreter.</p>

<p>When a man's chances are regarded as hopeless,
the invariable Australian comment is that "he's got
Buckley's." After having heard this stupid expression
a dozen times, I became curious, and set
out on the task of tracing the meaning of it. I
ascertained that at the beginning of the nineteenth
century three convicts escaped from a party which
landed at Port Phillip. Two were killed and eaten
by the blacks, but the third, one Buckley, escaped
death and lived on friendly terms with the aborigines,
to be found alive and well when Melbourne
was founded thirty years later. The remote chance
of escaping with his life which Buckley secured
has since been applied to all remote chances.
This is typical of Australian slang, and the visitor
who desires to understand fully the patois encountered
in this country needs to employ an interpreter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>In conclusion, it is only necessary to point out
that so objectionable is the Australian accent that
theatrical managers resolutely refuse to employ
Australian-born actors or actresses. Though a few
of these are possessed of talent&mdash;or what passes for
talent in Australia&mdash;the managers prefer to import
English artists of inferior merit, solely because they
possess the essential qualifications that Australians
lack&mdash;the ability to speak the English language.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

AUSTRALIAN MANNERS.</h2>


<p>Governor King, when in Australia in that administrative
capacity, wrote in a despatch of his
instituting an orphan school:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is the only step that would ensure some
change in the manners of the next generation. God
knows this is bad enough."</p>

<p>That was in 1801.</p>

<p>I made diligent search, and that is the last evidence
I could find of hope having been entertained
for Australian manners.</p>

<p>My observations during the last few months have
convinced me that the average Australian simply
doesn't know the meaning of the word. One thing
that struck me most forcibly is the despicable habit
of cadging invitations to the best social functions.
I find that it is quite a common thing for a citizen
who has been neglected in the case of a big ball to
ring up the gentleman in charge of the invitation
list, and remind him of the omission. This willingness
to humiliate oneself in order to gratify social
ambition was a revelation to me. Another thing
that left me dumb with astonishment was the boorish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
behaviour of your women in the trams. I have
repeatedly seen an alleged lady compel a man to
occupy an uncomfortable seat rather than move up
a little to make room for him. A glaring example
of this ill-mannered selfishness came under my
notice only the other day. A bejewelled female
sat on an outside seat with about a foot of spare
space on either side of her. A man got in, and
jambed himself between her and the end of the
seat. The man on the other side of her moved
up to allow the society dame to shift along, but
not she! She just stuck there, and ignored her
unfortunate fellow passenger altogether. It would
be difficult to find any country in the older and
more cultured world in which the common decencies
of civilisation would be so completely ignored.</p>

<p>Nobody ever considers the convenience of others.
People in the streets of every civilised portion of
the world&mdash;I don't say every "other" civilised
portion of the world&mdash;walk on the right-hand side
of the footpath. If one of them happens to be
eccentric or possessed of the anti-social instinct or
overcome by any cause and obstructs the traffic by
walking on the wrong side, he is promptly checked
by authority in the guise of a policeman. But in
the streets of Sydney there is no such law and order.
The public wander over the footpaths like sheep&mdash;and
with the same directing intelligence. The result
is that instead of there being two clearly defined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
streams of traffic on each footpath there is a struggling,
chaotic mass. Under intelligent discipline,
and with a people possessed of decent manners,
the immense London crowds that fill the streets
around the Bank and the Exchange and the Mansion
House flow to and fro to their destinations
like trains in a railway yard. But in Sydney,
where only a comparatively handful of people fill
the streets, all is confusion. There being no rule
of the path, there is no order. There being no
manners, there is no mutual courtesy to ease the
position. There being no chivalry, the women get
hustled, and the elderly and weak bumped and injured.
The police never interfere until somebody
is assaulted, and, as may be expected with chaotic
traffic regulation and ill-mannered people, this is
not an infrequent occurrence. But the moment the
offender has been dragged off the police retire to
their places by a verandah post, and the same
old rabble again fills the footpaths. Considering
that the police do not control the vehicles, it is
scarcely surprising that they permit the pedestrians
to wander where they will. Carts and horses
take any course they like. One never hears of anybody
being prosecuted for driving on the wrong side
of a Sydney street. A London policeman could
not believe his eyes were he suddenly transported
into an Australian city at a busy hour of the day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>As an example in chaos and ill-manners, the
Government provides the public with a tramway
system. The tramcars do not run on the wrong
side of the road. I'll say that for them. But
they commit every other offence against civic management
that it is possible to think of. It would
be difficult to find any tramways in the world in
which the passengers are treated less considerately.
The old motto of Boss Tweed, the Tammany
leader, was, "The public be damned," and the
Government of New South Wales seems to have
adopted it for its tramway department. As may be
expected, accidents are frequent. It is scarcely
possible for anybody who has not visited Australia
to picture what this means&mdash;a badly managed tramway
service, run by badly-mannered officials, and
carrying about double the number of badly-mannered
passengers. An old time bear-pit must have
been a refined assemblage as compared with a
Sydney tramcar.</p>

<p>The bad manners of the people are manifest in
other places besides the trams and trains and
ferries. It is impossible to find a woman who
will stand aside to let others in or out of a passage
way. One of the most common experiences is to
find two or more women standing in front of the
turnstile to talk while 50 or 100 persons miss the
ferry. The same thing occurs at the doors of all
the elevators in places of business, and at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
railway wickets. On the tramways, men and women
alike rush the doors the moment a car stops, utterly
careless of the passengers who wish to alight. In
the restaurants customers place parcels, umbrellas,
even hats, on the tables. Whether other customers
have any elbow room or room for their plates doesn't
trouble them one jot. Nobody ever apologises in
Australia. One gets used to that after one's toes
have begun to get callous from frequent treading on
by strange feet. One's dress may be spoilt by a
passing painter or by a fellow dancer at a ball
overturning a cup of coffee, but one never hears an
expression of regret.</p>

<p>The culmination of Australian bad manners was
probably reached when the New Year of 1908 was
ushered in. Australia on New Year's Eve follows
the silly practice of hanging about the streets of
the city generally doing nothing. But this time it
did something. It let off fireworks. It blew horns
and otherwise made a fool of itself. And eventually
growing tired of making a fool of itself, it
proceeded to make a hog of itself. The women, I
understand, were as much to blame as the men at
the outset. What followed cannot be related, but
the Saturnalia of Ancient Rome, the Bal des Quartz
Arts, and the worst of the orgies of seventeenth
century rural England all found excellent imitations
in the streets of Sydney that night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

MISS AUSTRALIA.</h2>


<p>Everything goes by comparison. If I were unacquainted
with England, America, France, Germany
and Italy, I might share the delusion cherished
by most Australian people&mdash;that your women
are beautiful. But, having seen the rose, how can
I be content with the dandelion?</p>

<p>In accepting the praise of Miss Lily Brayton,
your women should remember that this popular
actress had a royal time in Australia, and probably
was not unmindful of the possibilities of a
return visit. No, I am not a disgruntled actress
who has found Australian audiences unappreciative
of my talent. I am merely a much-travelled
woman blessed&mdash;or cursed&mdash;with the faculty of
being able to see things as they really are. When
I say that the women to be seen in the streets of
Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Hobart are unattractive,
I am merely stating the truth as it
appeals to me.</p>

<p>Someone with a surprising lack of humour&mdash;or
an extra large share of it&mdash;once wrote of the stately
carriage of Australia's matrons and daughters. In
my travels in this country the number of women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
encountered who knew how to walk might be counted
on the fingers of one hand. I have seen more grace
among the factory girls of Poplar, among the midinettes
of the Latin Quarter, and among petticoated
toughs of the Bowery, than it has been my fortune
to meet in Pitt-street or on the Melbourne Block.
Australian women don't walk. Those who don't
waddle with an unnatural movement of the hips,
like a drake expressing his satisfaction with an
extra fat frog, affect a ridiculous mincing gait that
resembles nothing so much as the painful perambulation
of a youngster who takes off his boots on a
hard, pebbly road for the first time.</p>

<p>The best figure I have seen in Australia was
that of a young girl of about 18. She was beautifully
moulded, with a bust to inspire a poet, and
hips of exquisite roundness. Generally speaking,
Melbourne women are more favoured in this respect
than their Sydney sisters. Here, due possibly
to surf-bathing&mdash;the bust development is abnormal,
while the hips have a flat, board-like appearance.
One Sydney woman with rounded hips was introduced
to me at tea at the Australia. She was so
well formed that I couldn't resist the temptation of
testing her genuineness with a hatpin. I don't say
that she was padded&mdash;I only assert that she took
half an inch of steel without flinching!</p>

<p>The best complexions in the Commonwealth are
seen at Hobart and Toowoomba&mdash;in fact, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
seems to be no really pretty skins at any other
places. Your women paint and powder too much.
The spectacle of young girls of 17 and 18 with
rouged cheeks and carmine lips is an absurdity in
a country that believes that its women are beautiful.</p>

<p>The new short skirt about to be tried in Paris
will never become popular&mdash;Australian legs could
not be held up to ridicule in that way. It is noteworthy
that while in other countries the girl with
a pretty ankle and a shapely calf is not unconscious
of her charms, the Australian woman is
always careful to adjust her skirt on seating herself
in tram or train. Why? Because she regards it
as immodest to show her legs? The display on the
surf beaches disposes of that idea. The answer is
found in the fact that, generally speaking, Australian
legs are better hidden from view. They are
either thick and stocky at the ankles, with a heap
of ill-formed flesh above, or are thin almost to the
vanishing point. One misses the beautifully-rounded
ankles and the graceful tapering calves that peep
from beneath petticoats in Bond-street, the Avenue
de l'Opera, and Fifth-avenue.</p>

<p>I was amused while at the Hotel Australia one
afternoon last week to notice that one "lady,"
who had evidently studied my first article in the
Sydney "Sun," was endeavouring to prove that
local legs are worth viewing. Her dress had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
carefully adjusted so as to provide a generous display
of stocking reaching nearly to the knee. Like
so many people in a young country, where the
polish and refinement that comes from association
with countries in which culture is a much more
highly-prized asset, is lacking, she failed to recognise
the border line that separates easy naturalness
from sheer vulgarity. A woman who pulls up her
dress deliberately in order to show her legs is pitifully
immodest. The woman who, with malice
aforethought, shows her legs is vulgar, and the
woman who takes all sorts of trouble to hide them
is a prude, but the woman who allows them to be
viewed, if the position in which she is seated permits
their display, is unaffected and natural. In
the society in which I moved in England, France
and America, both the women and the men are
frankly natural. Here there is, on the one hand, a
restraint that is ludicrous, and, on the other hand,
a familiarity that is indelicate.</p>

<p>Mr. Norman Lindsay&mdash;whose clever work I admired
long before I came to this supersensitive Commonwealth&mdash;has
done me a service in subscribing
himself as the man who has seen more of the
Australian girl than any of his envious countrymen.
If his knowledge is so extensive, and he is the true
artist that we all believe him to be, it follows that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
his drawing must reflect the local type. And what
do we find&mdash;the grace and beauty over which so
many of your frenzied correspondents have rhapsodised?
Not on your life. The Norman Lindsay
girl is hardly a girl at all. With the calves of a
footballer and the upper limbs of a Sandow, she is
a fearful and wonderful example of the female form
divine. The faces of Mr. Lindsay's women remind
me more than anything else of the religious
pictures of my youth, designed to represent the torments
of hell, and to frighten people into the narrow
way. Your foremost black-and-whiter admires
the beauty of strength. Well, a draught horse
with whiskers half way up its legs is a beautiful
thing to draw a heavy load of turnips or road metal,
but no one would think of comparing its ungainly
proportions with the symmetrical form of the thoroughbred
racer. If Australia is trying to breed a
race of Amazons, well and good&mdash;you are getting
along very nicely. But if you are anxious to match
your girls with the comelier women of other countries&mdash;you
have a perfectly clean palette, as my old
friend Charles Dana Gibson would put it.</p>

<p>People who read their history closely are familiar
with the evolutionary phases through which most
young countries pass. Here is first the halting,
apologetic stage, represented in the case of Australia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
by its early-day subservience to England and
everything English. Nothing could be any good
that was not imported. The next stage was reached
when you began to produce a handful of clever men
and women, whose success in science, music, art,
and sport laid the foundations of a belief that gradually
developed into arrogant big-headedness. If
Australia could produce a Brennan, a Melba, a
Mackennal, a Trumper, an Arnst, and a Gray, why
should there be any limit to the fertility of its
genius-breeding soil? The idea tickled your vanity,
and you allowed it to grow recklessly. People who
came from other countries saw your weakness, recognised
it as an inevitable phase in your progress
towards national sobriety and staidness, and said
nice things about you. It made the visitors' stay
more pleasant, and, as you will in time grow out
of your folly, it helped rather than impeded your
development.</p>

<p>Have you ever noticed a puppy let off the
chain after being tied up for a long time? He
will jump and frisk as though jumping and
frisking were the things he was born for, and
every time you pat him he bounds a little
higher. By-and-bye he begins to feel tired, his
tail-wagging becomes less vigorous, and eventually
he sits down quietly and wonders why he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
silly enough to exert himself so needlessly. He
notices, too, that the other dog who watched him
with amused tolerance isn't quite such a mongrel
as he seemed to be when he gambolled round him;
in fact, on closer inspection, he is recognised
as being bigger and possessing a shinier coat
than his chastened observer. The puppy has
learned wisdom. But that pawing and prancing
and hind leg foolishness were a necessary part of
his education, and every human caress helped
him along.</p>

<p>Australia is not yet through the cavorting stage,
but it will grow out of it in time, just as
other countries have done. If I were an altruist
instead of an impartial observer, whose tongue and
pen are always guided by clear vision and
ripened judgment, I would, I suppose, have helped
on the evolutionary process by feeding your
vanity with the tablespoonsful doses administered
by other visitors. I know I have made myself
very unpopular because I wrote the truth as it
appealed to me, but we all can't take liberties with
our consciences, even to please the women of Australia.</p>

<p>I have been in this country for several months,
so that I have had plenty of opportunity of judging
the external excellencies of my self-confident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
southern sisters. The diagrams which I have prepared
may help my critics to understand what a
perfect figure should look like. The outline of
the average Australian woman is shown alongside
that of my friend, Miss Maimie Valdervant, of
Fifth-avenue, New York. The colonial imperfections
are easily distinguishable&mdash;the pouter-pigeon
breast, the low, flat hips, and the thick, stocky
ankles. Miss Valdervant is a beautifully moulded
girl, but her shapeliness is not unique. At a weekend
party on the Adirondacks at least 10 of the
22 girls present were equally comely. Well do I
remember the late Stanford White saying, when
someone remarked upon his display of Phidias-chiselled
womanhood, that it was nothing unusual.
At the Grand Prix meeting at Longchamps Count
Pielliet's party was similarly noteworthy; the same
thing might be said of the late Viscount Avonmore's
famous gathering of 1907, in which I shared with
Lady Marjorie Warshane the honor of being the
finest figured woman on the lawn.</p>

<p>Who is Valerie Desmond, that she should dare
criticise the myriad Venuses of Australia? What
does she know of beauty? He who drives fat
oxen should himself be fat, and similarly she who
writes of the feminine form should have some
pretensions to shapeliness herself. I append my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
measurements for the benefit of my numerous
critics:&mdash;</p>

<p>The fact that I was asked by the late Sir Edward
Poynter to sit for one of his classical studies
indicates what a famous artist thought of these
proportions.</p>

<p>The reference by one visiting actress who attacked
me in the paper to Miss Annette Kellermann's
perfection of figure amused me. Everyone in
America, if not in Australia, knows how much of
her popularity is due to beauty and how much to
her press agent. Your clever and jolly water nymph
is anything but well balanced. Her legs are&mdash;or
were when I last saw them&mdash;much too thin for her
superb bust. It is just the reverse with Miss
Pansy Montague (La Milo). The upper half of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
her spoils an otherwise beautiful figure. The
genius of Cruikshank&mdash;an Australian of whom, in
his own particular line, his country has reason to
be proud&mdash;makes amends for this deficiency. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
was able to convince the English public that La
Milo was one of the most beautiful women living,
and the habit of admiring her became general. I
remember drawing Mr. W.T. Stead's attention to
her comparatively puny bust, but so completely had
Cruikshank gulled him that he wouldn't hear a
word against her.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to understand why Australian
women should regard themselves as beautiful.
You know the Papuan natives who stain their teeth
with betel nut think white molars hideous. When
any country sets up its own style of beauty it takes
a good while to convince it that any other style can
be beautiful, let alone to force the admission that
the local gods are false. So few Australians have
travelled that a restricted horizon is natural. I
don't say that your women have anything to be
ashamed of in having abnormal busts, flat hips,
and thick ankles, but when they arrogate to themselves
the right to set up a standard for the world
I really must protest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

AUSTRALIA FOR THE AUSTRALIANS.</h2>


<p>This watchword is the motto of "the national
newspaper." It is also the top note of all the
Labour party screeches.</p>

<p>The national weakness of Australia it shows is
instinctive. There is a distrust of its own capability;
self-reliance is totally absent; there is no
vital growth.</p>

<p>Never was the confirmation of such wretched
defects in a people so complete as in this confessional
clamour, this lack of combating power of
pride of race.</p>

<p>Ostensibly it is to exclude inferiors, but it really
argues against the incoming of superiors. In
striking contrast is it from the "Let 'em all come"
policy of Great Britain.</p>

<p>The screaming farce of the whole business, however,
is the education test immigrants are subjected
to. They must be able to write a line of some
European language. Why, official figures show
that there are in Australia nearly 400,000 persons
over the usual literate age who cannot read and
write.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Australia for the Australians" is merely the
cowardice shriek, "Preservation for the incompetent."
To exclude is to fear, disguised howsoever
it be.</p>

<p>Such widespread self-deceit as to its being anything
else is impossible of credence. It is the
craven state of pampered workers that has infected
all classes in Australia. Periodically the country
gets an attack of delirium tremens, and then it sees
the black man, the yellow man, and variegated
mankind generally with the upper hand.</p>

<p>And this is the hysterical way it then acts (vide
a Brisbane paper):&mdash;</p>

<p>
"ALIENS CAN'T LAND.<br />
NOT EVEN TO BE BURIED.<br />
A CUSTOMS DISCOVERY.<br />
</p>

<p>"A colored man named L. Peraira, second cook
on the B.I.S.N. Company's steamer Onipenta, now
berthed at the A.U.S.N. Company's Norman
Wharf, died on board the vessel on Wednesday
evening. Deceased had been attended by a doctor,
who certified that death was due to heart failure
caused by beri-beri. Under the circumstances the
usual certificate was issued, and arrangements made
for the burial of the body. Particulars of the
death reached the Customs authorities in due course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and it is stated they took exception to the landing
of the body for interment, and claimed that they
were acting in conformity with the terms of the
Alien Immigration Restriction Act. By the time
this attitude of the Customs authorities became
known, the undertaker had, it is said, completed his
work, and the body of the deceased had been
interred. It now remains to be seen what further
action, if any, the authorities will take in the
matter."</p>

<p>In the meantime the rich tropical lands are given
over to rank growths, and are referred to for
the purposes of borrowing and peroration as the
"great national resources of Australia."</p>

<p>When the Japanese squadron was in Australian
waters, the Admiral confided in the commanding
officer of the Commonwealth forces that both his
country and China had envious eyes cast upon these
self-same tropical tracts. If it were not for the
protection Great Britain affords Australia there
would be very little to stop either yellow Power
from materialising its envy. The Japanese squadron
told Australia plainly what it thought of its coastal
defences just as an indication of all this. Great
precaution had been taken not to allow any camera
parties from the Japanese boats over the fortifications
when in the port of Melbourne. The Japs
simply went and looked round casually. But when
they fired their farewell salute just without the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
"Heads" the squadron hove-to at a spot where it
could shell Queenscliff while not one gun in those
fortifications could be brought to bear on it. And
just at present we have the spectacle of a party of
Japanese explorers encamped within sight of
Sydney's main fortifications.</p>

<p>When Australia works itself into a cold perspiration
about the yellow man, it, <i>ipso facto</i>, acknowledges
the equality of him. The same with the
nigger who is, at the most, only wanted to do
the lowest form of tropical field work. But it is
the custom of the demagogues in Australia to talk
about "the dignity of labour" without discrimination
of any kind.</p>

<p>For the Indian coolie, say, to be able to do given
work at a less wage than a white, at the same time
doing it better, surely gives him some claim to be
considered in the economic scheme of things. Then
take the ethical point of view. The coolie lives a
less brutal life than the great proportion of northern
white workers, and shows a greater margin of
savings out of a lesser wage. He is thus emphatically
more desirable than the aforesaid proportion
of Australian white worker, which has no margin
out of wages after paying for beer, but usually has
the next week's wages mortgaged to the local
publican.</p>

<p>For it is only the wreckage, the scum of the
stream of life that drift to tropical field labour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
When I went among them I felt for the first time
the shame of the comparison of those of my own
race with the South Sea nigger.</p>

<p>Better fence the nigger into Australia and deport
the white who has sunk so low as to take coolie
work to some country where they have not laws
against undesirable immigrants. Australia is the
only country where the white is consumed with that
ignoble desire.</p>

<p>"But," shrieks the Labour agitator, "the Australian
spends his money and is better for the community."</p>

<p>Personally, I have scant sympathy and no
admiration for the fat-fingered publican and his
brother (by trade ties) the brewer.</p>

<p>The same objection was taken to the coolie as is
taken to the Chinaman&mdash;viz., he is saving and
economic. And if good citizenship is merely a
matter of spending money with the beer vendor&mdash;plainly
a false and untenable premise&mdash;then was
the Kanaka of all "desirables" the most to
be desired. All he got out of the production of a
ton of sugar, valued at &pound;20, roughly, was 30/-,
and at that cost he created a profitable avenue of
energy for the white worker. He never took a
shilling back to his island.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>The American is getting over "the dignity of
labour" trouble by machinery. The Australian
hasn't the brains to do likewise, nor is he a workman
as reliable as a mechanical contrivance, because
the latter doesn't get drunk or strike on any
pretext.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<i>THE AUSTRALIAN IN SOCIETY.</i></h2>


<p>There is no work for the phrase <i>noblesse oblige</i>
to do in Australia. The nearest one can get to it is
<i>noveau riche</i>. For in Australia the parvenu is
paramount.</p>

<p>The people have no ancestry to boast of; all
its nastiness is near the surface. If it isn't the beer
pump half the time I am very much mistaken.</p>

<p>For the other half history is not silent. Arthur
Gayle tells of it in the "Bulletin's" History of
Botany Bay. Not so very long ago he wrote: "We
are still ridden by the influence and ruled by the
lineal descendants of the squalid officialdom of the
grisly past. The whistle of the lash and the clank
of the convict's chain are still distinctly heard
though fifty years have passed away since transportation
ceased. The reason is, in a word, that the
men of the class that came into existence under the
Imperial regime made the most of their time. They
founded family fortunes and became territorial
magnates, the lords of the soil...."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>But it was not only "squalid officialdom" that
made the most of its time. Those comprising the
other class were also "in the van of circumstance."</p>

<p>
"Be thou therefore in the van of circumstances,<br />
Yea, seize the arrow's barb."&mdash;Keats.<br />
</p>

<p>They had in England been in a different kind of
van&mdash;Black Maria. Subsequently they got the
"Arrow's barb"&mdash;broad arrows. The genealogical
records have been destroyed, but ever and anon the
grim figure in prison garb steps out of the family
cupboards. Sometimes it is mere atavism. During
the visit of the American Fleet all the spoons were
stolen from the Flagship during a reception. Again,
when Shackleton returned from his Antarctic exploration
Esquimo dogs were stolen from the Nimrod.
Last time, however, that fifty thousand or so close-cropped
heads obtruded themselves through the
interstices of family cupboard doors it was at the
beck of Lord Beauchamp, who is an Australian.
He duly qualified as such by making a general
Australian of himself when Governor of New South
Wales. His first act of bad tact and worse taste
was to send this little Kipling slur over the telegraph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
wire to Sydney by way of showing that they must
regard him as one of themselves:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Greeting! my birthstains have I turned to good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forcing strong wills perverse to steadfastness;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first flush of the tropics in my blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at my feet success."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It showed an appreciative, social spirit&mdash;that
sort of Australian spirit that leads to calling each
other names, etc., at meals.</p>

<p>The next proof of his being an Australian was
for him to deny, through one Henry Lawson, that
he sent the slur. A friend of mine, however, has
seen the "birthstains" message in his handwriting,
and, furthermore, knows where it now is.</p>

<p>But tuft-hunting Sydney society obligingly pushed
the close-cropped heads back inside the cupboards
and tried to marry their daughters to the Australian
who had caused their ancestors to feel restive to
the point of obtrusiveness.</p>

<p>As he became more and more Australian, Lord
Beauchamp made a delicate concession to society
snobbery. He issued blue and white tickets when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
he entertained. It was a nice differentiation of the
status of his guests. Seidlitz-powder functions they
were called, but the recipients of both blue and
white went for all the disturbing elements.</p>

<p>And the matrons still pursued Lord Beauchamp
with their daughters. Eventually they ran him out
of the country.</p>

<p>As is usual with Australians, once he went to
England little more was heard of him. He married
there, however&mdash;that, of course, was cabled, and
Australian snob papers have since had domestic
details, including the birth and christening.</p>

<p>Whenever I have felt sympathetic with Australia
it has been on the score of what it has to put up
with from the cable man and the London correspondent.
She can't shake off her old Governors,
and she also has the relatives of those in gubernatorial
state inflicted upon her. For instance, when
Lord Brassey was falling out of, off, and under
things in Victoria,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote A.">&nbsp;[A]&nbsp;</a> an additional family misfortune
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>was cabled. His brother, while playing tennis,
was hit in the eye with a ball. Victorian society
liked it; it gave the opportunity to write condolences
and have the Government House orderly ride up to
its front door and leave the acknowledgment.</p>

<p>When the Australian pater-vulgarius makes a rise
in the world his daughters start to teach him
etiquette. If he blows his nose in the way we expect
Gabriel will announce himself one of these mornings
early, it is "bad form," and he may not even
know his friends of adversity. Fortune makes him
acquainted with well-fed fellows&mdash;at his own
board&mdash;to whom he is most affable. If he would
keep silent and let his money do the talking his
daughters would be less fidgety. It must be an
awful thing to try to regulate one's behaviour by a
book on etiquette, and, but for his bound and hide,
the torture of the new-rich Australian with a family
would be worse than vivisection. But he has bound
and hide. God is good to him.</p>

<p>But the family take the altered circumstances
seriously. They become finickety on the matter of
social distinctions. Had their father kept a shop
they cease to remember the fact, and shopkeepers
in general are altogether "beyond." So is now also
the reception of a suburban mayoress. For has not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the head of the house been made an M.L.C., bringing
them into contact with vice-royalty. It is as
often as not of the slightest, but the newspapers
only publish a list of "those present."</p>

<p>It is the same when these women are gathered
together ostensibly in charity's cause. Charity
begins at snobbery in Australia. Let the wife of a
Governor but take the chair, and the institution in
need of funds is "deserving" from the moment the
announcement goes forth.</p>

<p>Max O'Rell saw it all. Hear what he said:
"Colonial society has absolutely nothing original
about it. It is content to copy all the shams, all
the follies, all the impostures of the old British
world. You will find in the Southern Hemisphere
that venality, adoration of the golden calf, hypocrisy
and cant are still more noticeable than in England,
and I can assure you that a badly cut coat
would be the means of closing more doors upon
you than would a doubtful reputation." This was
really another way of saying Australia is a land of
doubtful reputations.</p>

<p>Everybody in Australian society is better than
everybody else, and everybody can give full and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
particular reasons why (including dates). The
position is obvious&mdash;everybody is trying to hide
what everybody else knows, and is prepared to make
even better known should occasion offer.</p>

<p>This is a natural consequence of money being
the "open sesame." It does not matter how the
money may have been acquired. The sons and
daughters of pawnbrokers, for example, loom large
in Melbourne society to-day. And butchers become
squatters. This, above all, the money must have
been made; society starts the nouveaux riches from
that point. Money covers everything&mdash;except the
women at evening entertainments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

THE AUSTRALIAN AT SHIRK.</h2>


<p>The masterly inactivity of the Australian is
something to marvel at. He is, of course, very
tired, but how he manages to get along without
doing any kind of work from early morn to dewy
eve throughout the circle of the golden year I
must confess knocks me kite high. It's not that
he dislikes work. He is really very fond of it&mdash;in
the abstract.</p>

<p>This is borne out by an account of Sydney
business methods published in an evening paper
of that city in the form of an extract from a commercial
traveller's diary. It is most illustrative:&mdash;</p>

<p>"MONDAY.&mdash;Called to see Mr. Beeswax, of
the firm of Beeswax and Bullswool, in the hope
of placing a big line of saddlers' ironmongery
with him. Mr. Beeswax sent out word that he
wanted something of the sort, but that, being
Monday, he was busy clearing up business left
over from the Saturday half-holiday. Asked me to
call again.</p>

<p>"TUESDAY.&mdash;Called again. Mail day. Mr.
Beeswax couldn't see me. To call to-morrow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>"WEDNESDAY.&mdash;English mail arrived late,
and letters only to hand to-day. Mr. Beeswax
busy with English letters. To call to-morrow.</p>

<p>"THURSDAY.&mdash;Called again. Mr. Beeswax
gone to Arbitration Court to fight his employees.
May be in again; may not. Most likely not! I
went to the Arbitration Court and waited. Beeswax
was fined &pound;100 for selling wooden dolls and
toothpicks in contravention of the 951st clause of
the Amalgamated Wooden Dolls and Toothpick
Makers' Union log. I decided not to approach him
for an order to-day.</p>

<p>"FRIDAY.&mdash;Called again just before twelve.
Cab was waiting outside. Just as I was shown
into the room, Mr. Beeswax was putting on his
hat. I said, 'About that saddlers' ironmongery!'
He said, 'D&mdash;&mdash; your saddlers' ironmongery!
Who won the toss, did you hear?' Then he jumped
into a cab, and said, 'Cricket Ground!' and drove
off.</p>

<p>"SATURDAY.&mdash;Only half a day. No hope of
seeing Beeswax, or anyone else for that matter.
Decided to go to the Cricket Ground myself and
join the crowd whose prosperity during the week
enables them to enjoy themselves on Saturday free
from care. I have no cares&mdash;no money either.
Next week there is a public holiday for the election,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
a levee, and another cricket match, so I don't
suppose I shall sell much saddlers' ironmongery
just for a while. Australia is such a busy place."</p>

<p>The only thing I doubt about this is the persistence
of the commercial traveller. I have seen
a good deal of that flamboyant person in my travels
of Australia, and the conclusion I formed of him
was that he was not out to do business so much as
to circulate the latest risque story, criticise the
management of railways and hotels, explain the
European situation, and generally to make the rustic
gape and feel discontented. He is the great Australian
"bounder."</p>

<p>Every Australian who isn't in the Civil Service
aspires to be a business man. Art and matters of
temperament are side lines, so to speak. Primarily,
it is the business faculty that is developed
in all lie-downs of Australian life. It is generally
as office boy that a start is made. The position of
office boy means that young Australia is paid ten
shillings per week to look through the "situations
vacant" column in his employer's paper every
morning, and apply for all positions advertised at
15s. per week by other firms, said applications to
be written on his employer's notepaper. If he
doesn't get another place quickly he knows he'll be
sacked, for nobody keeps an office boy in Australia
more than a week. Indeed, his record has been
sung in verse thus harmoniously:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Monday, hired;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tuesday, tired;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wednesday, fired.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One week you see the business man in the making
a messenger at a chemist's shop. Next week
he is carrying reporters' "copy" from meetings
to the sub-editor of an evening paper. The week
after that he is taking tickets at a picture show.
The following week he will be delivering circulars
down drain pipes. Then he will put in two days
sweeping up the hair about barbers' chairs in a
saloon and brushing customers up to the level of
the elbows where the bits of hair are not. He will
next take a spell at driving a cart, and after that
go bill posting at night. At this work he will
become acquainted with a theatrical manager, and
will abandon it to go on with the populace in melodrama
until he gets a job working a lift. He is
by this time a fully qualified clerk. At the age
of twenty he applies for admission to the police
force. All Australians do that, apparently under
the belief that it's the only position that will enable
them to keep out of gaol.</p>

<p>At twenty-five the Australian thinks it's about
time he fixed on some occupation. "I have had a
large and varied experience," he now writes when
applying for a billet. It is immaterial to him what
appointments are offering; he answers the lot. He
will manage a station or a tea-house or take a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
private secretaryship to a Minister of the Crown
or test eyesight for an optician. He doesn't mind
taking the message to Garcia&mdash;not he. He likes it
to be by way of a racehorse, however.</p>

<p>When he's fixed up in an occupation he thinks
will suit him, the Australian gets the sack. His
employer finds him absolutely useless. He has
not the habit of industry, and he is incapable of
sustained effort of any kind. Ask him (if he is in
a produce firm) the price of butter as quoted in
that morning's paper, and he won't know. But
he can give you the betting card at Tatt.'s without
hesitation. He is indifferent to everything
connected with the business of his employer. He
knows that if the worse comes to the worse he can
sleep out.</p>

<p>Australians who think of going to another country
with the idea of making a sleepihood should
inquire fully as to the climate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

THE LISTLESS POLICEMAN.</h2>


<p>The Australian policeman never knows anything;
it's no use asking him the time even.</p>

<p>This gives some idea of police protection, and
what goes on in Australia:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"SENSATIONAL ROBBERY.<br />
<br />
"&pound;600 WORTH OF<br />
GOLD<br />
STOLEN FROM A POLICE STATION.<br />
</p>

<blockquote><p>"The Inspector-General of Police has
been notified by the Superintendent at
Albury that a sensational robbery has occurred
at Tumberumba, in New South
Wales, and that something between &pound;500
and &pound;600 worth of gold dust and retorted
gold had been stolen from the local police
station."</p></blockquote>

<p>And from the same paper the same week:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"WHILE THE CONSTABLE SLEPT.<br />
</p>

<blockquote><p>"At an early hour this morning the
house of Constable &mdash;&mdash;, a constable attached
to Redfern Station, was broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
into. The constable had gone on duty at
an early hour in the morning, and about 3
in the afternoon went to bed in his residence
at Young-street, the other members
of his family having gone out. Everything
was properly secured, and it did not
enter the constable's head that anyone
would have the hardihood to break into
his premises. Some time between 4 and
5 o'clock, he got up, and went downstairs,
and was astonished to find that the
house had been broken into and robbed
while he slept. Entrance had been effected
by the kitchen window, the woodwork of
which had been smashed."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Australian criminal is the most clumsy scoundrel
in creation. He leaves enough clues behind
him for a jury to get to work on right away. But
unless he happens to leave his name and address a
cracksman working on a fair sized crib is never
caught. Most murderers, with the exception of
those who gave themselves up, are at large in Australia.
This last remark does not refer to cases of
murder followed by the suicide of the perpetrator.
A list of the undetected crimes of Australia would
cost too much to print.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_IX" id="Chapter_IX"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter IX.</span><br />
THE AUSTRALIAN'S PARASITICAL
TENDENCIES.</h2>


<p>The Australian is a born loafer. Go you north,
south, east, or west in his mortgaged land, and in
proportion to the distance you travel, so does this
truth broaden upon you&mdash;the truth of his loafing
propensities.</p>

<p>He is also a parasite. The big Australian parasite
feeds smaller parasites, and so <i>ad infinitum</i>.</p>

<p>Nationally the Australian has been a borrower by
choice. He is the spendthrift, ne'er-do-well, who
is always a drain on the old man's purse. He has
from the start been getting remittances from John
Bull in the guise of loans, which, like Micawber,
he redeems by more loans.</p>

<p>He has the borrowing habit bad.</p>

<p>The result?</p>

<p>If the Australian wants to develop something, a
mine, say, he makes a bee line to the member of
Parliament for the district, and through his pernicious
office enough is squeezed out of the milch-cow
government to sustain him until he can hawk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
what he has round London. He seldom has any
money himself, and when he has he prefers not to
risk it. The role of promoter suits him best. He
gets his profits out of his flotation, and impudently
stands in with the "paid-ups." As often as not
this latter trick is to give verisimilitude to his <i>bona
fides</i>.</p>

<p>His name is associated with the untamed feline
on the London market just now.</p>

<p>His private ideas about finance are reflected in
public accounts, particularly in the States that have
local government or irrigation boards. Sufficient
is it here to indicate his trend and point the baneful
influence&mdash;the antithesis of exalting to the country.</p>

<p>There is said to be honour among thieves, and on
the <i>prima facie</i> case thus made out, I cannot bring
myself to call the Australian business man a thief.
Americans have a term for a despised class of their
community, "Suckers" they call those who comprise
it. In its worst sense the term fits the Australian.
Wherever some sporadic energy is exhibited,
there do you find the suckers.</p>

<p>The sucker is chiefly found in big cities built on
borrowed money and by boom swindles. Thither
flock all who have foresworn honest toil, and the
disinclination to work, as has been already observed,
is innate of the Australian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>The sucker fastens on industry wherever it is to
be found, and if a district threatens to thrive, a big
town full of suckers arises to drain the profits, and
thus is the producer, who, in Australia, economically
is the country, impoverished. He and the
primary industries never get a chance. Things are
foisted upon him that he does not want and is not
in a position to pay for, and he can't move without
giving some sucker a commission. The commission
is generally for doing something, which, if he had
any sense, which he hasn't, the producer could do
for himself. So it happens that cities and towns
are over populated by suckers, who buy drinks for
the producer with the latter's money, and do ditto
for him who purchases what has been produced
(drinks again at the producer's expense).</p>

<p>And all this the reprehensible politician merely
calls centralisation. If he were less reprehensible,
he would acquaint himself with the state of things
and then set about remedying them. The figures
would astound a statesman. Think of it: the
population of the Commonwealth was last census
3,773,248, and 47 towns absorbed 1,859,313 of the
number! The increase per cent. of the population,
further, was only 1.71, while the cities are continuously
absorbing the rural dwellers. "Debts," remarks
Coghlan, "have grown at a much more rapid
pace than population."&mdash;[Statistical Account of
Australia.]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>The sucker curse is daily becoming more acute in
Australia. It so happens that the young Australian
whose father is trying to make a farmer of him
registers a resolution that he will be a sucker. With
justification, no doubt, he regards his father as a
fool. (All Australians regard their fathers as fools.)
The fool-farmer's son starts his sucking, therefore,
as a commission agent, and goes on the election
committee of the surplus Australian politician standing
in the "country interest," and whose watchword
is "settle the people on the land." The sucker certainly
does his best to settle the people on the land,
but not in the sense that the humourless politician
utters the shibboleth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_X" id="Chapter_X"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter X.</span><br />
THE AUSTRALIAN'S LACK OF
PATRIOTISM.</h2>


<p>It so happens that the Australian couldn't, even
if he wanted to, say, "This is my own, my native
land." That is, of course, with any degree of
truth. For the Australian has long since put the
country in pawn.</p>

<p>Instead of evincing any lofty sentiment, however,
the Australian is generally to be heard cursing his
country, and a good number of him get away from
it the first opportunity the good God gives them.
And small wonder. It is a land of burlesque. It
is built on entirely wrong principles. The mountains
are all round the coast, and they keep the rain
from going inside. The consequence is that there
is always a drought in the interior, which same
remark applies also to the Australian himself.</p>

<p>"It's a good place to live out of," says the ignominious
Australian, if you ask him anything about
it.</p>

<p>In his dunderheadedness he can't see that he has
fenced out enterprise, and is fast legislating himself
out of the country. The emigration figures of Australia
represent those of the inhabitants who can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
scrape a couple of hundred pounds together in order
to escape the national debt, the suckers, and the
reprehensible politician.</p>

<p>When it was proposed that Australia should
borrow the money in England to give England a
Dreadnought, one of the State Premiers was interviewed
on the subject. He sounded the depths in
patriotic sentiment by remarking, "It would be a
good advertisement!"</p>

<p>It is only in a Mr. Alfred Deakin peroration or
that of some other silver-tongue that you hear of
Australian patriotism. Silver tongue, by the way,
is a mere euphemism; there is a more direct and
much shorter Saxon synonym.</p>

<p>If Australia were a great country, it would have
the natural corollary, a great man. But it has
never produced one.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Parkes once proposed to erect a mausoleum
for the illustrious dead of Australia, but the
hopelessness of getting eligible corpses caused the
idea to be abandoned. There are, however, in Australia
many unexplained monuments. Among the
latest was one in Brisbane, raised to a deceased
Rugby football player. Will the Australian ever
get any sort of sense of proportion?</p>

<p>But a people, I suppose, must first of all have
love of country before it gets a standard of measurement.
If a plebiscite were taken it would be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
that the memory of Edward Kelly is far more revered
by the citizens of this mean country than that
of any other citizen. This national hero was familiarly
known as Ned Kelly. After a series of misunderstandings
with the police, he died suddenly
one morning.</p>

<p>The individual Australian, be it here remarked,
does not consider the collective Australian much
class, and the Australian who has travelled has a
sneaking disregard for his compatriots. If he has
spent two months in London, he returns an ape
Englishman. So far as loose clothes and cheap
mannerisms will carry him he is a Londoner. It is
a noticeable fact that he imitates the most inane of
insular types. The more howling the particular
London ass of the period, the more sincere the Australian
flattery of him. This needs no comment.</p>

<p>And when this two-months-in-England idiot returns
to Australia some gushing she-Australian will
say to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Absent Two-Months (Printer, don't
forget the hyphen), I can tell you're an Englishman.
You're so different from the Australian."</p>

<p>At this Mr. Absent Two-Months will smile
smugly, conscious of the higher appraisement.</p>

<p>Then he will commend her for her discernment in
words.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well&mdash;er, I was born out he&mdash;ah," he will
say, "But, you know, I&mdash;er have lived in England&mdash;haw!"</p>

<p>She just dotes on Englishmen. She likes the way
they turn their trousers up at the bottoms.</p>

<p>Then they start. He will agree with her in
sweeping depreciation of Australia and all who live
in it, and he will tell her what a jolly country England
is. She will sigh sympathetically to the cad,
instead of calling in the dust-bin emptier to pole-axe
him. It would be a more patriotic extreme.</p>

<p>Now how could this kind of woman kindle the
spark of patriotism in her children, assuming for
the moment that she was prepared to bear them?
How could she instil love of country? She has no
passion for things Australian. Her mother never
adopted the country for a start. She was one of
those wistful creatures who called Old England
"Home," and her children learnt it right enough.</p>

<p>And these Australian women are now lending a
voice in the country's affairs. The word voice is
used deliberately. It is about the only thing the
Australian will lend the country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

CLUB LIFE IN AUSTRALIA.</h2>


<p>I've been assured by fellow countrymen exiled in
this land that if you take an Australian into your
club he'll put his hand in his pocket and ask you
what you will have to drink. That, of course, is
just a little demonstration, meaning that he feels
perfectly at home.</p>

<p>The Australian clubs take on all sorts of names,
but the same atmosphere pervades the lot. In
some clubs are men who have been members for
years who couldn't tell you where the reading-room
was. They only know the way to the bar.</p>

<p>But to return to the atmosphere of Australian
clubs, I am assured by friends that it is engendered
of a rank and common suspicion that one member is
going to endeavour to borrow money from another.
One feels the constraint in the air at once, and no
one gets jolly and hilarious in consequence, but just
"cunning" drunk. A man can't escape the borrower
in Australia&mdash;and he gauges the standing of
a club by the magnitude of the loan a member
suggests.</p>

<p>A visitor to an Australian club can never be sure
as to whom he is going to meet. If a tailor happens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
to be in a fair way of business he probably makes
the members of some club feel uncomfortable every
time a glass door swings open. Pinero said something
derogatory about solicitors in clubs. They're
in all Australian clubs. I have heard of a solicitor
taking revenge out of an Australian who had been
dodging service of a writ, issued from the said
solicitor's office, for weeks. But the Australian
guessed the boy with the writ was on the pavement
and evaded the solicitor's stare by putting a comic
paper between him and it. One also meets the
dentist in most Australian clubs.</p>

<p>Some of the developments of the literary club are
peculiar to Australia. For example, on the selection
committee of the Johnsonian Club, Brisbane, is
a man whose greatest literary effort was the announcement
to a gasping audience that "There
were no cases set down for hearing at the Police
Court this morning." In the same club are many
who could not tell you who Boswell was any more
than some members of the Melbourne Yorick could
tell you what Hamlet killed behind the arras. If
you asked after midnight the most literary of them
they would, as one voice, say, "A blood-red
mouse."</p>

<p>I have been at some loss to know what makes a
person eligible for membership at one of the many
Australian city clubs. But enquiry has brought to
light some "pilling" episodes. I have known a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
father pilled for membership of a club and his son
go through all right. But the father had educated
the son up as a snob. He dressed better than his
governor and sponged on him. I have often wondered
if the old chap knew what a compliment the
members of the club paid him in deciding he was
not fit to associate with his son.</p>

<p>The languid swell element has invaded all Australian
clubs. Publicans' sons most do congregate
in them when people who work for a living are out
after a crust. These youths take mental exercise
reading the theatrical gossip and social columns of
the weekly snob papers. They are walking encyclop&aelig;dias
of useless information, and may be trusted
to make fools of themselves on all occasions.</p>

<p>They experience a great joy in pointing out to
foolish little girls in the street a man in the public
eye as So-and-So, "a honorary member of our
club." So-and-So, probably an imported actor,
however, is blissfully unaware of his advertiser's
existence.</p>

<p>These Australian clubs metaphorically tumble
over each other to have a distinguished visitor to
toady to, and to get a little of the reflected glory
they will sign chits for his drinks till all's blue, if
he happens to be sufficiently hoggish to keep pace
with them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>In the absence of any intellectual powers, the
Australian clubman's idea of thoroughly entertaining
a guest is to get drunk with him. To put a man
to bed&mdash;take his boots off and all that&mdash;is the height
of his hospitality.</p>

<p>Some Australians in their cups to-day will wax
reminiscent on the days when "the nights we used
to have at the old Bandicoot Club."</p>

<p>There is an expression in Australia, "Blind as a
bandicoot." It's at variance with natural history,
but most sayings are in conflict with fact in Australia.
Truth there dwells at the bottom of an
artesian bore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

THE AUSTRALIAN ON THE LAND.</h2>


<p>The man on the land in Australia is represented
by two classes, the squatter and the cockatoo
farmer. Why the latter is so called I am at a loss
to know. He never has a feather to fly with. The
squatter is more birdlike. He puts on a lot of
"wing," and some of him go so far as to flout a
crest.</p>

<p>Many of the squatters of to-day in Australia are
the descendants of cattle "duffers," as their nondescript
herds amply testify. A fine portly legislator
of the present time has a couple of well-stocked
stations, and generally looms large in Australian
landscape. One day, before he became smug, a
neighbour of his caught him with an unbranded
calf in his yard, and cried, "Heigh! That calf is
not yours!" "No," he called back, "but it will
be as soon as the iron is hot!"</p>

<p>I wouldn't like to be an Australian squatter for
many reasons. That is, of the old type. There are
a few importations of recent years&mdash;men with clean
breeding and clean money&mdash;from England. They're
all right. But they are not representative of the
class. As a class squatters are illiterate, and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
exemplification of the poet's mock logic that "The
man who drives fat cattle must himself be fat"&mdash;particularly
about the head. They are used chiefly
as members of the different Legislative Councils,
where they obstruct liberal land laws with much
vehemence and bad grammar. They are in the
main responsible for the slow settlement of Australian
agricultural lands by their relentless harassment
of the selector at every point. The result is a trend
towards land monopolies. New South Wales illustrates
the case. The evidence and finding of the
Lands Scandals Commission showed that a Minister
of the Crown in New South Wales accepted enormous
bribes to perpetuate this state of things; there
have also been land scandals in Victoria and Queensland.
In that State 24 men or companies hold 44
million acres between them, and hold this preposterous
area so tightly that when Australians complain
that it is unfair to judge the country's indebtedness
on a population basis they should remember
that this sort of thing debars immigration: it rather
accentuates the borrowing plight, by causing emigration.</p>

<p>The squatter encourages pests, not people, to
settle on the land. It was a squatter who introduced
sparrows into Australia, and rabbits, and
Scotch thistles, and docks, and the bot fly; also
swine fever. A squatter's son is a chip off the old
blockhead. When he's about twenty he's sent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
England for a brush up, and he either becomes an
absentee or returns to help make Australian cities
more vicious. As a rule he acquires a beautifully
discriminative taste for whisky, and what time he
is sober races horses on the most approved spieling
method. There was one of him in the Sydney
Equity Court recently, who said he had been drunk
for eight years, and that the whole of that time
was a blank to him.</p>

<p>The evening papers chronicled how many times
he had delirium tremens, and how many times he
had fits, and how as Vicar's warden he took up the
collection in the country church and breathed whisky
fumes on the congregation. He sat on the Bench&mdash;drunk:
he played polo&mdash;drunk: he was captain of
a volunteer corps&mdash;drunk: he read family prayers&mdash;drunk:
he started races&mdash;drunk: he sat on the hospital
committee&mdash;drunk: when he couldn't do these
things he was dead&mdash;drunk.</p>

<p>But to the cockatoo. There is little to be said of
him. He spends most of his time growling. He
would have you believe that his title deeds are in a
lawyer's office in perpetuity as security for loans,
while the local grocer invariably has a lien over his
crops. He is, as a matter of fact, mostly well to do,
but the way he lives it is to be hoped will never in
its sordidness be known to the other half of the
world. His wail for cheap railway freights and
seed wheat ceaseth not, and though he has learnt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
call himself the backbone of the country he is really
a national calamity. In the back country he is little
better than his dog.</p>

<p>Francis Adams says his heathenism is intense, and
that everyone in the bush is at heart a pessimist.
He has almost lost the power of speech, and his jaws
move with difficulty when he attempts it. Henry
Lawson, an Australian, tells of the intelligence of
the bushman at his highest development in a study
entitled "His Colonial Oath." He writes: I recently
met an old schoolmate of mine up country.
He was much changed. He was tall and lank, and
had the most hideously bristly red beard I ever saw.
He was working on his father's farm. He shook
hands and looked anywhere but in my face, and
said nothing. Presently I remarked at a venture:</p>

<p>"So poor old Mr. B., the school master, is dead?"</p>

<p>"My oath!" he replied.</p>

<p>"He was a good sort?"</p>

<p>"My oath!"</p>

<p>"Time goes pretty quickly, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"His oath (colonial)."</p>

<p>"Poor old Mr. B. died awfully sudden, didn't
he?"</p>

<p>He looked up the hill and said, "My oath!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he added: "My blooming oath!"</p>

<p>I thought my perhaps city rig or manner embarrassed
him, so I stuck my hands in my pockets,
spat, and said, so as to set him at his ease: "It's
blanky hot to-day. I don't know how you blanky
blanks stand such blank weather. It's blanky well
blank enough to roast a crimson carnal bullock, ain't
it?" Then I took out a cake of tobacco, bit off a
quarter, and pretended to chew. He replied:</p>

<p>"My oath!"</p>

<p>The conversation flagged here. But presently,
to my great surprise, he came to the rescue with:</p>

<p>"He finished me, you know?"</p>

<p>"Finished? How? Who?"</p>

<p>He looked down towards the river, thought (if he
did think) and said: "Finished me edyercation,
yer know!"</p>

<p>"Oh! you mean Mr. B.?"</p>

<p>"My oath!&mdash;he finished me first-rate."</p>

<p>"He turned out many good scholars, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"My oath! I'm thinkin' about going down to
the training school!"</p>

<p>"You ought to&mdash;I would if I were you."</p>

<p>"My oath!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Those were good old times," I hazarded.
"You remember the old bark school?"</p>

<p>He looked away across the siding, and was evidently
getting uneasy. He shifted about and said:
"Well, I must be going."</p>

<p>"I suppose you're pretty busy now?"</p>

<p>"My oath! So long!"</p>

<p>"Well, good-bye. We must have a yarn some
day."</p>

<p>"My oath!"</p>

<p>He got away as quickly as he could....</p>

<p>The Australian bushman has, what is generally
known as a "rat"; in fact, the lunacy of Australia
is most alarming. "There seems little doubt that
insanity is slowly but steadily increasing in the
States," remarks Coghlan, on the Commonwealth.
He is only working on the figures asylum returns
show. If only the idiots of the backblocks were included,
the mad rate per thousand in Australia&mdash;now
in excess of that of England&mdash;would stagger
humanity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

THE AUSTRALIAN TITLED PERSON.</h2>


<p>Everyone in Australia is in imminent peril of a
title. Nobody is safe. There is no saying whose
turn it will be next. When he gets up in the morning
the first thing the Australian does is to look at
the paper and see if his name is among the list of
those knighted or otherwise decorated. The distribution
seems to run like a sweep consultation. So
many K.C.M.G.'s, so many C.M.G.'s, and so on.
Then they put the names of all the people of Australia
into a hat and draw for them.</p>

<p>There is no other way of explaining how the
people who have titles got them, or why. In only
one instance on record is there a proper fit. It is the
particular case of a Sydney publican who sells threepenny
beers with a free "counter lunch." He was
made a C.M.G. The humour of the lottery once
more. It is most amusing to anybody from the
old country to see funny little men "Sirred" in
Australia.</p>

<p>People whose luck is so much out that they can't
draw a title make shift in the meantime with a
hyphen. It is just as well that strangers know this
for the purposes of answering invitations. Never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
forget the hyphen in Australia. No "family" is
without it. In the early days Brown was hyphenated
to Smith with a gyve.</p>

<p>The Australian titled person is mostly under-educated
and over-fed. He is of no particular use except
to company promoters, who put his name on the
front page of a prospectus. Sometimes he opens
a bazaar. He prefers, however, eating at complimentary
banquets tendered to anybody whose fellow
townsmen think justifies a gorge.</p>

<p>The prodigality with which the people responsible
hand out titles to Australians is no doubt part of
the scheme which sprang from the mind of William
Charles Wentworth, the originator in the country of
"that fatal drollery called representative government."
Wentworth was known as "the shepherd
king"&mdash;the titular craze again. There was also in
Australia a bushranger king. Hall, who was shot
by a policeman, was so titled by the New South
Wales Premier of the times, Hon. (afterwards, of
course, Sir) John Robertson. Hall owned a station.</p>

<p>But to return to Wentworth's scheme. It was to
found "a colonial aristocracy," a House of Peers&mdash;"a
replica of England rather than America."
Martin in his "Australia and the Empire" chronicles
the folly. "The subject," he wrote, "had
been for years maturing in his (Wentworth's) mind;
he even expounded his views on this question of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Australian House of Lords in a long-forgotten
article in the pages of an English magazine...."
Yet on this point of creating a brand new colonial
aristocracy he failed miserably. The commonest
street orator in Sydney could raise a ready laugh by
giving a list of the expectant "nobility." Robert
Lowe opposed it in the House of Commons, and his
criticism had all the weight of colonial experience,
while a young Sydney tradesman, by name Henry
Parkes, as Dr. Lang described the Premier of New
South Wales, first rose to public notoriety and
favour by his diatribes against this feature of Wentworth's
great measure.</p>

<p>The young Sydney tradesman afterwards drew a
knighthood himself, and didn't send it back to the
title lottery department of the Colonial Office.</p>

<p>There are certain fat people in Australia who are
scant of breath through pursuing the House of
Lords' will-o'-the-wisp. Desperate have been the
efforts exerted.</p>

<p>The progeny of the innumerable crop of pompous
low-order knights and colonial-made Gentlemen in
Australia does not benefit to any enviable degree.
Living up to a hyphen is bad enough, but when it
comes to an order it invariably means an inheritance
of debts, ending in passe daughters becoming manicurists
(an occupation not respectable since the gay
Lord Quex), and the sons up-country police-court
practitioners, or &pound;100-a-year civil servants. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
even footing with the low-order knights are the
"honourables." They approximate to Wentworth's
House of Peers, membership of State Legislative
Councils carrying the title. The "honourables"
guinea-pig mainly for a living. The title also means
Government House entree, and rating at functions
where there is recourse to precedence. Wives and
daughters thus get their hands on the social lever,
and so, later on, catch, with great adroitness, the
overworked reception smile of Governors' clever
consorts. Clever because it must often be so hard
to refrain from laughing outright.</p>

<p>I should like to share some of the fun at the various
Government Houses after a reception.</p>

<p>It is rather rough on them, though, not to be able
to enjoy the comedy while it is in progress. Seldom
can they. There is, however, a time on record when
they did to the full&mdash;so did many others who had
a "Burke's Peerage" on their library shelves. The
Duke of Buccleugh was cabled to have sailed for
Australia. "A title!" cried some. "A Duke!"
gasped other Australians. Society was agog. But
it was only a very well-bred bull shipped for stud
purposes.</p>

<p>Is it any wonder that "the commonest street
orator" can raise a laugh when Australian titles are
mentioned?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

THE AUSTRALIAN AT THE BREAKFAST
TABLE.</h2>


<p>From a close observation of Australian restaurants
I have come to the conclusion that the Australian
does not eat his food&mdash;he wolfs it. He's
not very particular either what he eats. (In Queensland
earth is in his dieting scale). What he chiefly
wants is something to chew, and he usually bites off
more than he comfortably can.</p>

<p>He's argumentative at the breakfast table, and
the less he knows about a subject the more he'll say.
One of him wanted to argue with me only the other
morning on this very subject of eating. The argument
turned on the word "dinner," and he let his
porridge get cold while he went for a dictionary.
"<i>To dine</i>," he said, with his mouth full, "is to
'take dinner,' and according to this dictionary that
is 'the chief meal of the day.'" That's just it&mdash;the
Australian regulates it by size; he cannot distinguish
between a meal and a dinner.</p>

<p>Delicate glass, spotless napery, flowers, and above
all sparkling conversation&mdash;those larger delights!&mdash;he
does not encourage. He is a mere gross feeder.
I am talking now of the man who can afford these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
things (even the employment of a conversationalist),
not of the sixpenny "Dining" rooms, of which
Australia is the home. How horrible these
"dining" rooms are on a hot day! You can smell
them two streets off. If you are brave enough to
look in you will see what you usually go to the zoo
at 4 o'clock to watch.</p>

<p>There is no restaurant in Australia where you can
get a meal suited to the climate, and as for "home"
meals, well, if an Australian asks you to his house
to dine don't go unless you're an ostrich. Cooking
among Australian women is a lost art. The Australian
girl goes in for "accomplishments" only.
If she is ever called upon to cook anything she uses
the frypan.</p>

<p>If I ever set up business in Australia it would be
in three "lines"&mdash;frying pans, false teeth, and
patent medicines.</p>

<p>Everything is washed down in Australia with tea.
It is a dangerous beverage as it is made there, in
witness thereof are the clayey complexions and dyspeptic
noses of the women. Why they don't drink
wine, the natural beverage of the country, I never
could make out until I tasted the vintages. But
they are improving. Some foreigners are making
very decent wine in Australia just now; but the
Australians won't drink it until it is exported and
returns again to the country with a French brand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
on it. The same remark applies to most things in
Australia. They don't manufacture anything. I
once dined with a squatter in Queensland, and there
was not an article of furniture in the room that had
been made in Australia, and not a thing on the
table, except the vegetables, but was imported. The
table linen, the glassware, the knives, the crockery&mdash;all
were imported. The wine was imported, so was
the salmon, and the coffee, and his "Missus's" cat
was Manx. And yet there wasn't a thing in the room
but the raw material could have been produced in
the country, right down to the condiments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

THE AUSTRALIAN POETS.</h2>


<p>When I went into the Public Library at Sydney
and asked for the catalogue of the Australian poets
I thought the attendant, in complying, had handed
me the Federal electoral rolls. He said, however,
that it was all right. There are just about as many
people anxious to make the poetry of the country as
there are to make its laws, and among them all they
have made a mess of both. Parkes, addressing a
public meeting, once said, "I would rather be a
third-rate poet than a first-class politician." Somebody
interjected: "Well, aren't you?" I thank
God when I think of the few awful hours I spent
with the Australian muse (or, more correctly speaking,
bemuse) that I have read very little Australian
poetry. Nevertheless I have read enough to enable
me to arrive at a definition of what really constitutes
a right to be called a poet, and it is: Any
person of either sex who can write in metre without
being laughed at. In applying this golden rule it
will be seen that there are no poets in Australia
except the alleged humorous versifiers.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Parkes, deceased, is generally referred
to in the Australian Press as poet, politician and
patriot. I haven't the time to inquire into all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
other things, but I did spend an hour with his
"Fragmentary Thoughts" and "Stolen Moments."
They are well worth perusing, and I think everybody
ought to read those sympathetic lines "To a
Beautiful and Friendless Child; aged four years."
The child was aged four years; it is not "an early
poem," which fact I thought it just as well to mention
before quoting the opening stanza:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Did shock of birth-bliss slay thy mother?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How from all kindred torn?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than God's all-seeing eye, what other<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Said that a man was born?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the poet is even better in his stirring moods,
as in the well-known (in Australia) "Australian
Youth's Song." Here is one of the "jewels four
lines long":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We live in hope&mdash;we live in hope!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Forget the day that's gone!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or dim or bright, the future's light<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is all to guide us on."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A strong man would shed tears over the same
poet's "The Dying Convict's Letter." For that
reason I shan't quote it any further than to say it
begins:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In mental agony he lifted up<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His voice to Him who hears the sufferer's prayer...."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That's just what you feel like doing. The spirit
of humility expressed in the poem is in sharp contrast
to the ferocity expressed by a brother bard,
who, on leaving Australia's shores, shook his
clenched fist at the continent and recited some lines
ending&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The rich man's Heaven, the poor man's Hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Land of &mdash;&mdash;, Fare thee well!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There has been a lot of controversy in the Commonwealth
as to the missing word, so I leave it
blank, and pass on to the ode that won the New
South Wales Government prize of fifty guineas, in
open competition, as being the best "Occasional"
for the birth of the Commonwealth. Listen to the
opening:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Awake! Arise! The wings of dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Are beating at the Gates of Day!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And that was addressed to the Australian for the
purpose of arousing him! What chance had it of
doing so; the Australian merely turned over and
said, "Why the blanky blank should I get up?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
It's just as well that all should know here and now
that the only way to waken Australia is to heave a
brick at it&mdash;same as I'm doing.</p>

<p>One of the best known poets of Australia, I
understand, is the Rev. Mr. Cuzens, who published
a volume entitled "Footprints of Jesus." I make
bold to reprint a verse of "The Temptation":</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A dreary wilderness, a desert wild<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of Nature's varied loveliness despoiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Stretched out, I see, in barrenness and woe<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A fitting emblem of the world below;<br /></span>
<span class="i9">Deep gloom and dread<br /></span>
<span class="i9">The land o'erspread."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I cannot say of what denomination the rev. poet
was; but I understand it was written before the
days of the Salvation Army commenced to enrich the
world's library of hymns.</p>

<p>There was also a poet named Kendall, of whom
Australia is very proud. The Press critics call him
an "impulsive songster," and I do remember taking
a little thing of his away in memory after reading a
collection of his verse. The little thing went:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There is a river in the hills<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I long to think about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps the searching feet of man<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Have never found it out."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></div></div>

<p>It suggested to me at the time "Mary had a little
lamb"&mdash;slightly uneven in the feet. Kendall was
accused of purloining from Tennyson, and he explained&mdash;"We
cannot pass through the woods without
taking away the smell of violets." But that
wasn't the charge; it was that he dug the violets up
by the roots and transplanted them in his own
pages. But Kendall has gone; he has also his reward.
I saw a life-sized painting of him in the hall
of a Sydney sporting hotel when I was staying
there. For what more can a poet ask in Australia?</p>

<p>Brunton Stephens, though he wrote in Australia,
received his impression and education in the old
world. He did not adopt Australia till he was 31
years of age, and a man gathers few new impressions
after thirty; he lives in and writes of those of
youth. Thus, strictly speaking, Stephens was not
an Australian poet. Yet he was the only man in the
country who ever wrote with a philosophic outlook
(and a knowledge of prosody). He was not an admirer
of Australian poetry either: "It lacks a
fundamental basis of brain" was his verdict. Poor
Stephens, Stephens the stickler for the precise word,
the admirer of literary craftsmanship&mdash;this is what
he got at the hands of an Australian bard, who
wrote a critical biography of him on the literary
page of the National newspaper; mine are the italics
and parenthetical remarks:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>"He was the youngest of a family of six&mdash;two
brothers and three sisters." (Stephens once taught
mathematics.)</p>

<p>"Fielding, Smollett, Shakespeare, <i>and</i> the English
classics were more to the boy's taste than
athletics...." (What nationality were F., S.
and S.?)</p>

<p>"At 11 his father died...."(!)</p>

<p>"The position was secured for him through the
influence of a fellow student named Simpson, whose
father later on became the discoverer of chloroform
as an anaesthetic&mdash;and a knight." (Intrepid Simpson's
father.)</p>

<p>"They (the Leylands) literally rolled in riches."</p>

<p>"Within a week he delivered a lecture on 'The
Antiquities of Egypt' in the Brisbane School of
Arts." (! again).</p>

<p>"Men of Stephens' temperament too often have
made mistakes in marrying&mdash;it is sufficient to say
that Stephens married the predestined woman."
(As a matter of fact Stephens was most happily
married.)</p>

<p>I merely mention these things to show how they
treat a poet in Australia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>For the rest, the Australian poets are pessimists,
alleged funny writers, and parodists of Swinburne
and Kipling. Paterson's writings smell of horse
sweat and stable sweepings. Lawson sings of
Colonial beer&mdash;which, dear English reader, God
spare you from ever tasting&mdash;Daley retails the
philosophy of that blasphemous old reprobate,
Omar, with this difference&mdash;a pewter of Colonial
beer, not a jug of wine. And then there are
Gordon, and Sladen, John Cash Neild, Mr. Furtell
and Farrell. The last mentioned wrote a poem
"How he Died." I've never read it, and don't
want to, so can't say how he died. But if it was
an Australian poet who was dying I know how he
ought to have been killed. In the pleasant metaphor
of his own country, he should have got it
where the chicken got the axe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XVI" id="Chapter_XVI"></a><span class="smcap">Chapter XVI.</span><br />
THE C.Y.A.</h2>


<p>This title, which attaches to all Australians during
a period of superficial precocity, has great local
significance. It means clever young Australian,
and it originated in the newspapers, where the
phrases are the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever.
For instance, no Australian editor would let the
name of Chatterton pass without adding "Wonderful
boy."</p>

<p>C.Y.A. is, therefore, a newspaper degree. It is
conferred most heartily&mdash;and with rather less discrimination
than Ally Sloper's award of merit&mdash;by
junior reporters. Mothers just yearn for it, and
the local newspaper is obliging.</p>

<p>An Australian mother tells her daughters to be
clever&mdash;and let who will be good. The result is
much cultivated mediocrity&mdash;mechanical pianists,
and thin voices taught to sing Tosti's "Goodbye"
for the inevitable subscription concert to raise funds
for further futile study. There is in every town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
in the Commonwealth, a coming Australian, but
none of them ever seem to do any arriving. Someone
is, all the same, for ever getting a benefit (of
the doubt) in the shape of the aforesaid subscription
concert. It is given out that she is going to the old
world to study under Marchesi or someone sufficiently
afar to make the passage money a consideration.
It's a regular confidence trick, for no sooner
does the shock of the beneficiary's awful singing
blow over, than she is back about town again.
Perhaps she has realised enough by the fraud to buy
a piano and a brass plate and she sets up teaching
others to follow in her devious ways.</p>

<p>Strict justice to the Australian songster compels
me to say that a few of them do achieve to the
position of chorus girls. I heard some chorus girls
of the old school complain in a caf&eacute; one night that
"what with these Conservatorium girls cutting the
screws the profession is going to the dogs."</p>

<p>There have been some Australian women who
have reached London and hit that city hard. Melba&mdash;Nellie
Armstrong that was&mdash;managed it. She was
not a C.Y.A., however. She has outlived one of the
adjectives before she went "Home." When she was
singing at shilling concerts her fellow Australians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
hadn't the gumption to hear anything wonderful in
her notes. Melba recently swept through Australia
in a semi-regal way, and was queen of a champion
grovelling match.</p>

<p>Ada Crossley also found London. She came back
and found Australia, which wouldn't look at her at
a 1/- some years before when her notes were fuller
and richer, ready to pay half a guinea a time of
its creditors' money to see what her gowns were
like.</p>

<p>Of the many other singers who left Australia's
shores the most have been engulfed in the city of
the Thames. Some bob up now and again, when
their voices are to be heard at pops. But most of
them would like to raise a return fare, and that is
probably their last illusion.</p>

<p>And then, of course, the stage attracts the C.Y.A.
Anything that looks easy and is likely to bring
adulation always does. But I have made exhaustive
inquiry and failed to discover one actor or actress
who learnt the business in Australia that has turned
out anything worth mentioning. I have traced
several to London and there given them up&mdash;the
men in pity and the women in disgust.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>The founder of the drama in Australia was Barrington,
a convict-actor. Some idea of his ability
as an actor may be formed from the fact that he
was ever convicted.</p>

<p>In the drama Oscar Asche is the only man I can
find doing fairly well, but he did not learn his business
in Australia. Indeed, it is part of Australia's
ignominy to see English and American artists being
imported to play any parts requiring the exercise of
intelligence. Managers, when interviewed as to why
they don't employ Australians have given it as a
reason that the Australians cannot pronounce
English properly, and that they have a distorted
idea of love-making. The fact is that by the time
the Australian gets a part he is so furtive with
dodging creditors that he cannot get apprehension
out of his face when any other character makes an
entrance.</p>

<p>The artistic Australian also gets to London.
Mortimer Menpes was a C.Y.A. He went from
Adelaide&mdash;a town which also produced the late
Mr. Guy Boothby, C.Y.A. Menpes, in writing his
biography for "Who's Who," stated that he was
"inartistically born in Australia." What does he
mean? He was before the time of incubators.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Boothby&mdash;late Guy Boothby! I don't
know how he could ever have looked a bookstall in
the face after what he wrote&mdash;or his fellow Australians.
Nat Gould or Fergus Hume either, for that
matter. Between them these Australians used to
average four books a month, fifteen short stories and
two puff interviews by Mr. Boothby with himself,
written up for the magazines. Mr. Boothby found
plenty of good material in himself for interviews.
Haddon Chambers, C.Y.A., also gives the magazine
readers glimpses of himself, but of late years he
seems to spend all his time in protesting that he <i>did</i>
write the "Tyranny of Tears."</p>

<p>Then in the realm of high art is Longstaff,
C.Y.A., painter, Mackennal, C.Y.A., sculptor. The
first is head and shoulders above the other Australian
daubers, but he'd have to get on stilts and
wear the highest stove pipe to be classed eminent
in London; the second gets odd jobs which the
cableman chronicles betimes.</p>

<p>Probably if you asked any Australian the best
Australian book he would say "For the Term of
His Natural Life," by Marcus Clark. Well, I just
recently read in Duffy's "Life of Two Hemispheres,"
that Charles Gavan Duffy wrote it. He
particularly says so.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>Rolfe Boldrewood, C.Y.A., is also classed a
literary man in Australia. He wrote numerous tales
of colonial improbabilities.</p>

<p>There is a paper in London called the "British
Australasian," and it follows the doings of the
C.Y.A.'s in London as far as it can with self-respect.
But when frequent changes of address
make it too plain that the C.Y.A. is bilking his
landlady, and the change of locality is from humble
to worse&mdash;well, it discreetly draws the curtain. The
"British Australasian" is a most genteel publication.
It was one of the first to drop De Rougemont,
C.Y.A.</p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
